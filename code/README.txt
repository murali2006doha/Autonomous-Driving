data-road:
	-test:
		-calib: the calibaration files for test images

		-results: the disparity, depth, gt & predictions (all generated by our code)
		-right: right test images
		-test.txt: is a file with all the image number on seperate lines
	-train:
		-calib: the calibaration files for train images
		-gt_image_2: the gt images
